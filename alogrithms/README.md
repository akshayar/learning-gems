## Algorithms

### Recursive algorithm
```

if(test for base case)
	return some base case value
else if (test of another base case)
	return some other base case value
else
	return ( some work and then recursive call
```

### Problems
5. 
6. Design a stack that supports push , pop, top and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
